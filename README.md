<h1 align="center">Hey, I’m Nandan.</h1>

<p align="center">
  I like robots. And robotics. And tech in general. <br/>
  If it’s got a processor and a potential for overengineering, I’m probably interested.

## About

Currently deep in robotics, systems, and embedded tech.  
I spend more time with terminals than touchscreens.  
To me, `git push` is just another form of self-expression.

  Like my code: minimal, direct, and slightly overclocked.
